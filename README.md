# Cookiecutter Data Science

_A standardized minimal template for projects in the TB research unit at the Swiss TPH._

###Important note
This template is effectively a fork of the [`cookiecutter-data-science`](https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science) repo put together by **drivendata**.  We wholesale buy into their philosophy as outlined on their [Project homepage](http://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/)

-----------
 - Python 2.7 or 3.5
 - [cookiecutter Python package](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) >= 1.6.0: `pip install cookiecutter`
